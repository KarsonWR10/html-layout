            Food. There are gratuitous amounts of it, and so many scrumptious combinations that taste great together. Out of any kind of food in the world, steak is my favorite because the texture, tenderness and tastiness go way beyond my food expectations, which are quite difficult to beat. Filet, prime rib, sirloin, T-bone, rib eye, teriyaki, New York strip; so many different kinds of steak and they all have that little flavor that other meats don’t live up to. This is why I believe in steak.

            When I go out to a fancy restaurant with my parents, I already know what type of food I know I am going to have before we even get there. No matter what, I have steak in mind, while my dad’s wallet doesn’t. After we get seated and the waiter asks what drinks we will be having, I pick up my menu and go straight to the steak section. About a minute or so later, my dad will try to hint at getting something cheap and says he’ll get a burger, and the idea of a burger just further forces me to think about getting steak. This is because a burger is like a cover band of the Eagles when compared to steak. A burger just doesn’t quite measure up to the real thing. So then I tell my dad what I will be getting, and with a little mild arguing and a reluctant ‘yes’ from my father, I get my wish of steak for dinner.

            Another reason I believe that steak is the greatest food ever, is because everything tastes excruciatingly amazing with it. When I am at a restaurant and looking through the sides that I could eat with steak, I think to myself, “Any of these would taste fantastic.” Thinking about what sides to get with the steak makes my mouth water increasingly until my mind can barley handle it. The list of sides is sometimes ten things long, from French onion soup to steamed veggies, and I have to narrow it down to one or two! Considering what I would be in the mood for at this exact moment, I would have to go with mashed potatoes and green beans. If I were to get something like a burger or pasta, the choices would be much easier because fewer sides taste as good with those less classy meals.
